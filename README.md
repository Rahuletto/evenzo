# Evenzo

An event management API made with [Hono](https://hono.dev/) ðŸ”¥ with [Cloudflare workers](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/workers/), using [Cloudflare D1](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/d1/). Hono is fast, scalable and works on the edge networks making it zippy.

> Made for SRMKZILLA club submission

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Built with Cloudflare Workers.
- **Database**: Utilizes D1 for data management.
- **API Documentation**: Self-documented with OpenAPI and Swagger. `/docs`

## Installation and Setup

> [!TIP]
> If you are not interested in running with the source, you can test it out with the [deployed url](https://evenzo.rameshrahul1974.workers.dev) > `https://evenzo.rameshrahul1974.workers.dev`

### Prerequisites

- [Cloudflare Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rahuletto/evenzo.git
cd evenzo
```

2. Install Wrangler CLI:

```bash
bun add -g wrangler
```

3. Log in to Cloudflare:

```bash
wrangler login
```

4. Create a Cloudflare D1 database

```bash
wrangler d1 create events_db
```

Have it's id, it is necessary.

5. Configure the database in wrangler.toml:

> Change `example.wrangler.toml` to `wrangler.toml`
> You should use the ID generated by wrangler

```yaml
name = "evenzo"
compatibility_date = "2024-09-28"

[[ d1_databases ]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "events_db"
database_id = "ID"
```

### Running the app

1. Install all dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

2. Run the dev server

```bash
bun run dev
```

This starts a server at `localhost:8787` (most probably)

3. Deploy the api
   To deploy it in your cloudflare workers

```bash
bun run deploy
```
